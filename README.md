- Hi, I’m Brandon
- I’m interested in snowboarding
- I’m currently learning French
- I'm originally from Hawaii
- I'm a Junior in computer engineering
- I chose my major because my whole life I have been very interested in gaming and technology/electronics in general
- A fun fact about me is:  I have never been out of the country, but I plan to take a trip to Japan this Summer
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Further my coding speed and capability
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Tuesdays with Morrie
